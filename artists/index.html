<a href="https://soundcloud.com/egocent" target="_blank"><h2 class="artiststuck">Egocent</h2></a>
<p class="paratuck">Egocent is stripped down, straight forward techno, evolving into sometimes deep, experimental forms. It's all about power, momentum, and explosions. Formerly a member of Cybertech, Egocent has followed his musical path from livesets to own production, from playing others' tunes to banging them out himself. Moving between Germany and Belgium, the flavor of the continent penetrates all his work.</p>
